# Prison 2 Data Editor
Edits SirFaizdat's Serialized Prison files.

Let's be honest. A LOT of people complain about SirFaizdat's Serialization save system, mainly because it's not easy to edit. Well now it is. Prison 2 Data Editor gives you the option to create serializable files¹ and edit them to work with Prison 2. And best of all, it's FREE!

To get started, download the Windows² (sorry Mac users) setup from the bin directory and run it! Simple as that! The installer is pretty straightforward, but if you find yourself clueless, just hit next through the whole installer!

1) As this is the first release, the Mine creation feature is disabled for now due to perplexive bugs.

2) A Mac version of Prison Data Editor will not be released, but a "PrisonData to JSON converter" will be released soon.
